    <!-- Internal Styles :An internal style is a way to apply CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) directly within an HTML document by placing the styles inside a <style> tag,which is typically located in the <head>section of the HTML file. Internal styles affect only the specific HTML document where they are defined,and they do not apply to other pages. -->
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>

        <!-- The <a> tag, also known as the anchor tag, is used to create hyperlinks in HTML, which allow users to navigate to other pages, websites, or even different parts of the same page. The content between the opening and closing <a> tag becomes clickable.

        Attributes: 
        href: The href attribute defines the destination URL of the link. If href is omitted, the link wonâ€™t work.
        target: This attribute specifies where to open the linked document. Common values are:
        _self: Opens the link in the same tab (default behavior).
        _blank: Opens the link in a new tab or window.-->
